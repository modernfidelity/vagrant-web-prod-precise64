Machines

This will then build the following vm boxes : 

- <strong>Load Balancer { varnish, niginx}</strong>
  - *33.33.33.30 (port forward 3030)*  
- <strong>2x Web { php, apache}</strong>

These VMs are based on Ubuntu Precise 64 Bit => http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box

Notes
-----
*Please note - you might get port errors if you are running other services on those ports. 

If this does occur you will need to either change your current service running on that specific port to another 
or amend the VagrantFile config file...
